# Heart_disease_pred
This Python program predicts heart disease using machine learning. It loads a heart disease dataset, explores it with visualizations, and selects key features. The data is split into training and testing sets, then a logistic regression model is trained. It evaluates the model's accuracy on both sets to assess its performance.
